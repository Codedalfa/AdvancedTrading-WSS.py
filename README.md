Python code for CB Advanced-trading Websockets
Make sure python is installed before using the script. 
To check that type Python3 and enter .If it is installed you should be able to see the Python interpreter starting with '>>>'
Next install pip incase you do not have it. Use the following to install pip: curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
Next step is to install dotenv module
We would need to install it in the same folder where we install python, for example your bin folder. Just cd to bin and then type the following command: pip3 install python-dotenv
After that if you run the script you may get a websockets module error. 
To solve that, cd to your bin folder and then run the following command pip3 install websocket
Make sure you see a successfully installed message after the process.
